[33mCMake Warning (dev) at /usr/share/cmake-3.26/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (PkgConfig)
  does not match the name of the calling package (gazebo).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.

  Add the installation prefix of "my_box_bot_gazebo" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "my_box_bot_gazebo_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "my_box_bot_gazebo" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
